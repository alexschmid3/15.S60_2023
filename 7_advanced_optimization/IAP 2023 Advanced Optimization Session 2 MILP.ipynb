Now he can take some valuable items with him during the isolation phase. He has $N$ items, each with a weight $w_i$ and a price  $p_i$. Because he is feeling weak, he can only carry $C$ kilos. How does he choose what to bring with him so as to maximize the total value?\n",

To do this we'll also keep track of a list $L$ of subproblems left to solve; initially, it's just the relaxation. The procedure is:\n",
