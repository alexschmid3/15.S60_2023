    "\n",
    "Suppose we are given a noisy image, and we want to clean the image up. In countless movies and tv shows, we have seen our hero figuring out who the killer is by polishing a very noisy image in seconds. In reality, this takes a while, and usually is done by solving an SDP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example. Suppose we are given this very noisy image. This image is the noisy version of a test image widely used in the field of image processing since 1973. See the wikipedia entry [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna) for more information."
