# Preassignment 3

As preassignment for session 3, we'll make sure we can open and execute a notebook in Google Colab.

Google Colab is a user interface to execute Python code. It is extremely similar to Jupyter Notebook, except that it is online and runs on GPUs, for free!

Please go to [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rCwyWnMYuy8gZWRpSSR81cblFWPyZgXr?usp=sharing) and make a copy of this repository to your Google drive. For that, please follow the instructions carefully.

Then check you can execute cells as instructed, and upload a screenshot to Canvas of the requested cells.

See you on Tuesday!
