# Lecture 5: Advanced Deep Learning

This session is divided in 4 parts:
- Part 1: Review on NNs and Extended Notions on CNNs
- Part 2: Tutorial on Transfer Learning for Computer Vision using Keras
- Part 3: Sequential Tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks
- Part 4: Advanced Deep Learning Concepts and Buzzwords

For part 2, we will use a Google Colab notebook. Follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oQo5IsO4C6xBb6EFoaoinmYqvj1pg62I?usp=sharing) to open the notebook. After that, please save a copy in your own drive so you can follow the class and make modifications.
We suggest to run a few cells before hand to make sure the notebook compiles on your browser.

You can find the .pdf of the slides [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r9wr38xnrl0cfj8/Advanced%20Deep%20Learning%202022%20Public%20Version.pdf?dl=0).



### Lucky you! 
There is no preassignment for this session! Please just make sure the notebook works and feel free to skim through it before hand :)

See you on Tuesday!

### Questions?

Please email LÃ©onard at leobix@mit.edu for any questions about this session.

### Homework

The homework is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10IMhJUiAepquOQsSSNSqX232veozk6mD?usp=sharing). You will have to implement your own transfer learning workflow or ConvNet to classify the CIFAR dataset. Good luck!
