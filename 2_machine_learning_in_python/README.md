# Preassignment 2

Before the first class, please complete the following tasks. 

Completing the pre-assignment will ensure you have all of the software needed to follow along with the session that covers the Regression and Classsification in Python Lecture.

## Task 1: Install Anaconda3 with Jupyter Notebook

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python (and R) programming language for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform that combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations and more. **We will use Jupyter Notebook throughout the lecture**.

Please go to [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) and follow the instructions to install Anaconda at your local machine.

## Task 2: Run the Pre-assignment Jupyter Notebook

Please launch Anaconda, launch the Jupyter Notebook named `pre-assignment 2.ipynb` and run all commands.

## Task 3: Take screenshots of the outputs 

Please take screenshots after the execution of all commands. Please make sure all command outputs are visible, with emphasis on the package installation / loading and the final command. 


Thank you very much and see you in class!
