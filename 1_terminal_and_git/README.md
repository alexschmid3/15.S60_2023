# Preassignment 1

Before the first class, please complete the following tasks. 

Completing the pre-assignment will ensure you have all of the accounts and software needed to follow along with the first session that covers the basics of Terminal, Git, Github, and project management.

## Task 1: Make a Github account

We will be using Github to distribute code throughout the course. Please go to [www.github.com](www.github.com) and make a free account.

## Task 2: Install Git

Please navigate to [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git. Follow the installation instructions (you might already have it installed) for your operating system.

For Windows users, the download will include Git Bash. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash (a popular default shell on Linux and macOS), some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system. 

Open terminal (macOS/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows). "Clone" the Github for this class by entering the following command (we will talk about this more in the session):

`git clone https://github.com/alexschmid3/15.S60_2023.git`

This will create a copy of the Github course materials in the folder to which you cloned. **Take a screenshot of your output after successfully cloning.**

## Task 3: Submit screenshots on Canvas

Put the screenshot from Tasks 2 in a single PDF file and submit on Canvas.
