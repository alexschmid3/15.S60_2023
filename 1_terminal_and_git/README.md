# Preassignment 1

Before the first class, please complete the following tasks. 

Completing the pre-assignment will ensure you have all of the accounts and software needed to follow along with the first session that covers the basics of Terminal, Git, Github, and project management.

## Task 1: Make a Github account

We will be using Github to distribute code throughout the course. Please go to [www.github.com](www.github.com) and make a free account.

## Task 2: Install Git

Please navigate to [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git. Follow the installation instructions (you might already have it installed) for your operating system.

For Windows users, the download will include Git Bash. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash (a popular default shell on Linux and macOS), some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system. 

Open terminal (macOS/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows). "Clone" the Github for this class by entering the following command (we will talk about this more in the session):

`git clone https://github.com/alexschmid3/15.S60_2023.git`

This will create a copy of the Github course materials in the folder to which you cloned (the folder will be your home directory if you simply typed the clone command above). If you'd like to see the result, you can navgiate to that folder and see that you now have a new folder called "15.S60_2023". Throughout the course, we will update this Github with the materials from each workshop and you will be able to make a copy of them on your computer with one command in Terminal/Git Bash. 

**Take a screenshot of your terminal/Git Bash output after successfully cloning.**

## Task 3: Submit screenshots on Canvas

Put the screenshot from Tasks 2 in a single PDF file and submit on Canvas. 

## Questions? 

Email Alex at aschmid@mit.edu.

## Connecting Git to Github (not part of pre-assignment, though it should have been, sorry!)

To use terminal and git to push changes to Github, you need to tell git/terminal who you are and authenticate your Github credentials. We do that through an SSH (secure shell) key. Follow instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to generate an SSH key and add the key to your Github account.
