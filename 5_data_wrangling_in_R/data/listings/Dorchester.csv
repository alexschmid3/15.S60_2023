I'm from Dublin, Ireland and moved to Boston 6 years ago. 

Loved to travel around Europe and always enjoyed the hostels we stayed in! After moving to the states I have tended to remain up here in the North East, travelling around Massachusetts to New Hampshire up to Canada - generally on the hunt for good skiing.

While in Boston I try to balance things out between working away as a code monkey and trying to pull together a startup. With a few hours still going to waste, I've gone back to school with evening classes up in Harvard Extension. 

I love having friends over - I'll throw together some random event, be it Johnny Appleseed Cider Fest or a Spaceballs movie night. Something to get friends together.

We are at the top of the hill, so you can see the ocean from the yard, and we get ocean breezes all summer. My house was built in 1880 for the daughter of the farmer that owned the hill, and though the neighborhood is part of Boston, it still has a suburban feeling, with giant trees and plenty of yards. In past decades it has become home to immigrants as well as old New England families; about half the arrivals were from Ireland, but also some from Italy, Eastern Europe, Vietnam, the Carribean and Cape Verde. In winter we help eachother with shoveling snow; people stay a long time, as it is a pleasant place to live.","We have extra guitars and other acoustic instruments; also games and fun books, some in Italian, French or Spanish,  to relax with after a long day  (including Asterix!).

Walk or bike to several beaches and bike trails (we can rent you some bikes!), or take a quick subway ride to see the historic Boston center or visit the cultural and academic areas of Boston. We are a quick subway ride on the Red Line to the financial district, MGH, Boston Common and the Freedom Trail, MIT, UMass Boston, the Kennedy Library, South Boston, Lesley, Harvard, and more; or take a ten minute bus ride to the BU medical center and medical school. Several restaurants within walking distance with ""best of Boston"" write-ups, also grocery stores, ice cream shop, and breakfast cafe on the way to the subway station. Fifteen minutes from Santander Bank headquarters and the Italian consulate.","Rooms are fully furnished; shared kitchen fully equipped; rent includes WIFI, utilities, laundry facilities, easy onstreet parking. Bathrooms and common areas are shared.  There are two full bathrooms and one half bathroom. Breakfast isn't provided but kitchen facilities are available.  Off-street parking is an extra fee, but there is plenty of on-street parking available for free.","I live in the house; if I am not travelling, I am available for advice about getting around Boston and about restaurants and shopping nearby.  I speak Italian and French, and understand Spanish.","Guests who use kitchen must wash their dishes (or put them in dishwasher) and wipe stove and counters after eating, in courtesy to other guests.
