I can most likely send you to at least one place you would never find on your own. I am a former Boston concierge, and local attorney and I hope you take me up on my hospitality advice and don't need any legal advice during your visit to Boston lol--but if you do, your stay with me includes a free legal consultation! 
My guests have access to the very best restaurants, café’s, bakeries, pastry shops and Italian import stores in all of Boston and they are steps from Girasole.  Many Italians have names for their homes to make their sense of arrival and time spent there more enjoyable. Girasole is the Italian word for “Sunflower” but the literal meaning of Girasole in Italian is “turns to the sun.” It is my pleasure as your host to turn you toward what are the brightest, best, and most Italian of experiences that are available in Boston’s Little Italy. Inside Girasole there is a list for you to make your wandering around the neighborhood more purposeful so that you can run into the best life has to offer during your stay.

Additionally, my mother's residential real estate office, Meridian Realty Group, is located on the ground floor of our Gloucester Street brownstone / townhouse, facilitating easy communication and immediate assistance with any issues.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

If you stay with us during the summer months, we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor.

I say that I pursue the ""impossible"" because these things have never before been achieved; however, I would argue that the reason is only because the proper plan wasn't put into place and set into action. :) 

Some quick facts about me: I was born in China but raised in the US - and I have lived in Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri, and, lastly, New Hampshire. I am a recent college graduate (Washington University in Saint Louis) with a degree in International Area Studies. I am 22 years old. My current home is in Manchester, New Hampshire where I am serving as a proud member of City Year, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to addressing the national dropout crisis by putting young people into classrooms to both tutor and mentor ""at risk"" children. 

I am a friendly person (I think haha) and I love to travel and eat new foods. I would say that eating is one of my top hobbies and an embarrassing amount of time/brainpower in my each day is devoted to  figuring out how to make food/get food. My current plan in progress is to make homemade ginger beer (i.e. ginger ale). Fingers crossed! 

In addition, I like to watch Asian dramas, baking, reading. Also, I am a pretty consistent runner/gym goer (I mention this because this wasn't always the case ... sticking to that New Year's resolution!) :)

A walker's paradise, but should you wish to explore beyond foot: - North Station (Green): 5-7 mins - Haymarket (Green, Orange): 5-7 mins - Uber: doorstep ;-) If you have a car, there are a few local lots - the closest of which, ""Pilgrim Parking,"" is located on North Margin Street btw. Cooper and Stillman. Unfortunately there aren't any free parking options in the North End, as the area operates on residential pass only.","Thacher Street is quiet, right off Prince, and within walking distance to all of the North End's best spots: Monica's Salumeria, the North End Church, Improv Asylum, Neptune Oyster and more. The building is very safe, and the manager has lived onsite for over 20 years. Utilities: - Heat and AC unit in the bedroom window - Full wifi (network and code will be provided) - Full kitchen (stove, dishwasher, oven, fridge, freezer) - Large bathroom  - Bluetooth speakers in reading nook - Full Comcast cable NOTE: This is the handicap unit on the floor, meaning the bathroom and kitchen are larger than most in the building, and square in shape. It also means there is empty space beneath the kitchen and bathroom sink to allow for wheelchair access.","I'll be available via email and cell phone throughout your stay to answer any questions you might have. Since I live here, I'll work with you to coordinate a key drop in advance.","The usual: no smoking, no parties, no pets (sadly)! Please remove shoes upon entering the apartment, and be mindful of neighbors. It's a quiet building at any hour of the day, so do try to preserve the status quo.

Additionally, my mother's residential real estate office, Meridian Realty Group, is located on the ground floor of our Gloucester Street brownstone / townhouse, facilitating easy communication and immediate assistance with any issues.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

If you stay with us during the summer months, we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor.
