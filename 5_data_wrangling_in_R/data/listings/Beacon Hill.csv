Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

Since there's no lobby and AirBNB isn't like a hotel, before check-ins and after checkouts, there's no place to store bags if you have excess time on your hands. But there are some off-site options.  1.) If you're taking a train (and have the ticket to prove it), there's storage available at South Station (not North Station) through Amtrak. They don't have lockers, but for $3 per bag, you can store your suitcases in the Amtrak Baggage Room. The baggage room is located at the very beginning of track 12, on the left. It operates between 7am and 9pm. They don't do overnight storage, so the luggage must be picked up by 9pm. If you have any questions, you can reach the baggage room directly by  contacting Amtrak-Boston (FYI, they won't always answer right away if they're busy). 2.) If you're not in possession of an Amtrak ticket, anyone has access to the Package Express storage area. As of July 2015, they charge $10 per item, and they're open from 7am - 8pm on weekdays and","Boston's great for getting around. Here are some options! 1.) BIKE: Hubway is Boston's three-season bike sharing network. You can download a handy app called Spotcycle (select ""Boston"" as your city) to see all the Hubway stations.

Every stations has a kiosk to swipe your card and get riding - it's like having a bike all over the city!  1A.) You can also rent bikes - just web search it - there are many options.  2.) WALK: Boston is actually very compact and quite walkable. You might be surprised how close some things are. Go on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps and type in your destination and hit the pedestrian button to see walk time.  3.) THE ""T"" TRANSIT SYSTEM: The MBTA works quite well most of the time. (It gets very crowded during rush hour, by the way.) Maps and apps are widely available for this system.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Ideal for anyone visiting downtown Boston & Cambridge on foot, with historic 19th century charm right outside your window. A nice quiet second floor studio in a building built in 1895.  Windows south facing, providing warmth and light year-around.  Heat with thermostat control, and AC unit in summer.  Queen size bed with firm pillow-top mattress and extra folding twin-size memory-foam mattress.  Full bathroom with shower&tub within the apartment.

A couple of wood framed gems from the 17th and 18th centuries tucked in here and there.  Little passageways through blocks.  A couple of very nice playgrounds.  Great proximity to esplanade, Boston Common and Charles street (shopping/restaurants).","The T is an excellent way to get to the apartment.  It is located within a 3 minute walk of Charles/MGH station on the Red Line.  Park Street (Green line) is 7 minutes.  Bowdoin Station (Blue line to/from Logan Airport) is 3 minutes' walk away. If you drive here, note Parking is limited, this is downtown Boston!  For a one day stay, the cheapest thing to do is park on Cambridge st or in a Beacon Hill Visitor Parking spot overnight--it's limited and you will often have to hunt (circle) for this free parking.  Read all signs on the block.  Ask questions if you're not sure.   Boston will fine you up to $150 for parking in the wrong place and will tow in the middle of the night if you mess up. Boston has no visitor permits, especially portable paper ones (because they wouldn't be able to deal with the preponderance of forgeries)","The best location for subway access in Boston.  Blue line at Bowdoin (now open full hours of operation-BEST transportation from Logan Airport!), Red line at Charles/MGH), or Red, Green and Orange at Park street.  North station is a 5 min walk away for Commuter Rail and Downeaster.  South station is the third stop from Charles MGH on the red line.  Or an enjoyable 20-25 min walk through downtown.","Check in time is 1pm or later.  Check out is by 12 Noon.

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.
