Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",within an hour,100%,100%,FALSE,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mission Hill,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",TRUE,TRUE,"boylston st., Boston, MA 02215, United States",Fenway,Fenway,NA,Boston,MA,02215,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.3462145727819,-71.09372008506031,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,0,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",Essentials,Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron}",NA,$99.00,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,$0.00,1,30,today,NA,1,3,18,283,2016-09-06,184,2014-09-06,2016-08-19,76,8,7,8,9,9,8,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,flexible,FALSE,FALSE,7,7.53

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",within an hour,100%,100%,FALSE,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mission Hill,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02215, United States",Fenway,Fenway,NA,Boston,MA,02215,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.34569073544391,-71.09326627246774,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,3,1,0,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-Hour Check-in"",Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron,""Laptop Friendly Workspace""}",NA,$99.00,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,$0.00,1,45,today,NA,1,3,14,284,2016-09-06,71,2015-09-23,2016-08-21,79,9,7,8,9,9,8,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,flexible,FALSE,FALSE,7,6.07

I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.

I grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.

Out of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.

Upon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students' heritage and culture.

In the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.

Step out your front door and you will be steps from some of the city’s most renowned restaurants, shops, museums, parks, theaters, nightlife and sporting events. The Longwood Medical Area and Harvard Medical School are practically in your backyard and with the proximity to area Universities you can be assured that something exciting will always be happening in your neighborhood.","Although we do not allow pets in our apartment, this apartment is located at a residential property that allows pets and there may be pet owners in the building.","Most locals get around town by foot, giving Boston the name, ""the Walking City."" Home to the first subway system in the United States, public transportation is well-developed, but congested, so many students, residents, and visitors choose to walk. When walking is not practical, the  Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority  offers commuter rail, rapid transit, light rail, bus, and trolley services. Logan International Airport, located in East Boston, is the area’s main airport. Fenway gives you everything you love about city living and with a T-stop right next door, you’ll be free to explore all Boston has to offer with ease.","You have access to the entire apartment, and all the fantastic amenities this building offers to its tenants.",We have local staff that you might meet in person that meticulously prepares the apartments for your arrival.
