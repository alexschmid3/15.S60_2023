We are the proud parents of four children between the two of us; 2 amazing kids each from our previous marriages (ranging in age from 8 - 15).  

I grew up in Marblehead, MA so have a love of the ocean that I am pretty sure comes from a childhood of summers at the beach and winters eating clam chowder and watching storms stir up the waters into a frenzy of crashing waves and foam.

My husband grew up in South Africa and has lived here for almost 20 years.  Between the two of us, we love to travel and explore the world whenever we have the time and resources.  

We are non-smokers.  We treat every home like we would want our home to be treated.  We love to entertain so will sometimes travel with friends or our extended families.  

5 things I cannot live without?
Love, the Ocean, my Children and Husband, my Purse and my Friends.
