Please keep in mind:  You will be sharing common areas with me, and the cleanliness of the common areas is more dependent upon all guests cleaning up after themselves than it is upon my cleaning. Most guests do very well in keeping common areas clean!  House rules: Kindly remove shoes upon entering my apartment. I ask this because my hardwood floors are very old, and shoes increase the noise to my elderly downstairs neighbor (who is wonderful, so I do what I can to make life easy for her).

I'm using technology to make the human experience more joyful and bountiful. It's wonderful that Airbnb does this in big and small ways.

On the road I'm curious about local favorites and spots off the beaten path, and you'll usually find me with guidebooks and a working itinerary. Two of my favorite places are Paris and St. John. My craziest trip, though, was backpacking through China—12 cities in 14 weeks (phew!). My dream destinations are Italy and Ibiza.

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

Please feel free to contact me to ask me any questions, or if you want to hear my voice to assure that I am a real person. You never know these days . . . my roommate tried to buy a puppy online and it ended up being a fraudulent agency that tries to scam people for money. So, yeah just reach out to me and I will be more than happy to give you more details about myself or my place.

I hope you enjoy your travels, and get some good deals. Cheers!",N/A,N/A,N/A,FALSE,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b1eaa7d5-4485-4cde-aedc-026d3478ecdc.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b1eaa7d5-4485-4cde-aedc-026d3478ecdc.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,South End,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']",TRUE,FALSE,"East Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02118, United States",South End,South End,NA,Boston,MA,02118,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.34346177505992,-71.0641953929085,TRUE,Loft,Entire home/apt,2,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{""Cable TV"",""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,Doorman,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",Essentials,""24-Hour Check-in"",Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron}",NA,$100.00,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,$0.00,1,1125,10 months ago,NA,0,0,0,0,2016-09-06,1,2015-12-01,2015-12-01,100,10,10,10,10,10,10,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,flexible,FALSE,FALSE,1,0.11

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

I migrated to Boston from Milan, Italy at 19 and after completing Boston University History Bachelor of Arts, I studied architecture and photography at Boston Architectural College. My passion for interior design and photography gave me a unique sense of what I would like a new home to look like. I fell in love with South End of Boston and became one of the early pioneer developers responsible for rebuilding the then abandoned housing stock of this neighborhood.

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

I started on Airbnb with our Cape Cod property in May 2015 and then listed this newly renovated Boston property on August 1 after a year long building process! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 10 years and have wonderful reviews on the We Need A Vacation website (id# 7281). Also,  I was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston for 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status on October 1st and again on January 1st of this year!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, wife to David, my partner in life and all things real state and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is in her senior year of high school and off to Chicago to attend Northwestern in the Fall.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.
