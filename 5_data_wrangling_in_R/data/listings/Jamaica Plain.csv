I moved to Boston five years ago after having lived for more than 30 years in three different countries on as many continents.  I have a passion for travelling  and, since my migration to Boston, have so enjoyed  the experience of hosting other travelers through Airbnb, in addition to  a non-paying website.

I'm a virology scientist working in Boston. Research can be an isolating job so I'm excited to be able to meet others from around the world and hear about their lives and exciting travel stories.

I'm clean, tidy and quiet. If not at work, I will most likely be at home baking, reading or resting. My favorite spot is the Arboretum near my house, it is a wonderful place to visit and exercise!

I'm described as being sweet and friendly by friends, and I will do my best to help and make you feel at home.

I look forward to meeting you, and please don't hesitate to ask questions about Boston even if you can't stay here.

I grow things. The garden is one of the best things about this house. It's gotten a little insane. Growth is a little rampant. It might eat you before you reach the front door. I apologize. Send up a flare!

Some of the most amazing times in my life have come about through traveling or hosting travelers to this beautiful city. I love meeting new people, hearing about their adventures, learning more about where they come from, and helping them have a wonderful time here in Boston. 

I've had Thai people help me count the steps out loud in Thai when visiting  a mountain temple in Chiang Mai. I've kayaked from Cambridge, down the Charles River, through the locks, out into Boston Harbor, and into a dock outside The Barking Crab restaurant for a lunch of fried clams—a local favorite! I've been to New Orleans to work with Habitat for Humanity in rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. I've hiked the White Mountains. I've trekked France, I've studied Spanish in Madrid, I've tossed bread crumbs to fish in Greece. 

Come to Boston, and I'll do everything I can to make sure you make wonderful new travel memories here, dining under my grape arbor, visiting your children's college, walking the Freedom Trail or whatever else you wind up doing!

Here's a little bit about me-
I studied photography and worked as a professional photographer for the past 25 years. My favorite type of photography is Documentary and photo journalism. You might see some images of my work around my home.
I know my city well, and I love giving my guests tips and ideas for fun things to do. So please tell me a little bit about you and why you are coming to Boston. wether you want to stay local and find out more about JP, or if you want to explore the downtown areas of our city, I can guide you. 
I also consider myself a new urban gardener. I started a small gardening business a few years ago, and I participate in a community garden down the street from my place. 
I especially love meeting new people and hearing their stories. After traveling through Italy this past Spring (2015) and staying at several airbnb's, I decided to try it myself. I think I will make a great AIRBNB host because I like to make people feel comfortable and I like to chat. We went to Italy to celebrate my daughter's graduation from Syracuse University. We really enjoyed the AIRBNB experiences we had.  
My friends say my home is very welcoming and friendly. Currently, my daughter and another Syracuse Grad are living on the second floor with me and our cute cat named Remi.

It  can comfortably house 3 adults, and a possible fourth if you are willing to use the trundle bed in the living room, but which does make it a bit crowded in the living area.  There is also a queen airbed for use in the main living room, and an inflatable child bed",none,"Jamaica Plain is one of the most fun and funky neighborhoods of Boston. There are many restaurants, bars, galleries, and other entertainment options. JP is very gay-friendly.  We are also spoiled for green space - Jamaica Pond is within easy walking distance, and the Emerald Necklace string of parks links Jamaica Pond with the Charles River, with a lovely bike path running the whole way to the river.  We also have both the Arnold Arboretum (265 acres) and Franklin Park (zoo, golf course, trails, etc.) which are within easy distance as is the home of the Boston Beer Company, brewers of the famous Sam Adams beer.","As noted above, there are STEEP STAIRS up to the unit, and a NARROW SPIRAL STAIRCASE up to the 3rd floor bathroom and bedroom so please take that into account in your decision about whether this is the right unit for you; if these might be a problem for you, you will be happier in another space. This unit is not a good choice for people with mobility issues, balance problems, or frail elderly persons.  Also please note there are 4 twin beds; given advanced notice I can provide a double airbed for use in the main living room, and I also have purchased an inflatable child's bed which will fit in the upstairs bedroom.  There is a cat on the premises, but she does not enter the unit.  There are 4 twin beds which are quite comfortable.  As noted above, if you would prefer a double, we do have an inflatable airbed which is also comfortable but not as nice as the twin beds.","We are about a 7 minute walk from both the Stony Brook and Green Street stops on the MBTA Orange Line (the ""T"") and downtown  Boston is an easy 15 minute ride on the T, or on the  39 bus which stops 2 blocks away.  In addition, we are very conveniently placed for the Longwood Medical area and for Fenway Park.  There are Hubway system rental bikes placed nearby and numerous Zipcars, and Uber cars are usually no more than a 6-10 minutes wait. There is free limited on-street parking.","You are welcome to use the shady deck with table and chairs, and gas grill.  I have two friendly dogs (Beanie, brown dog, and Diamond, yellow lab mix) and a cat (Zozo) who do not have access to the unit, but they do spend time on the deck.  I will introduce you so that they know you are a welcome guest. There is on-street parking, and we are very close to the T and several bus lines, as well as to bike trails.","We live on the premises and will be available to help during your stay and to answer any questions you might have.  We are happy to share our ""secrets"" about the best places to eat, drink, and have fun!  There is a notebook in the unit with suggestions for getting the most out of your stay as well as a range of Boston guidebooks, and a book in which previous guests have left some suggestions and favorite places.","We live on the premises - two women,  two dogs and a cat. We are a strictly NON-SMOKING household - this includes all smokeable substances. We tend to stay up late, so late arrivals to about 11 pm or so are OK. We can arrange for a later check-in via a key box, but we may not meet you in person until the next morning. Check-in is after 5 pm except by prior arrangement, and checkout is at 11 am promptly to allow time for the unit to be cleaned before the next guest. This is a quiet residential neighborhood so please, no parties or loud music. There is door from the 3rd floor onto the roof as a safety exit, but the rubber roof is very delicate.  If you are tempted to walk out on the roof, please do so in your bare feet only.  There is no railing for the roof.  Under no circumstances may children access the roof.

Option 2: The PINK ROOM, available every day all year round, is a beautiful private room in our three bedroom home. This custom built (by me, with help) house, is an urban artist's paradise that feels like a cottage in the woods. 

A BIT ABOUT ME: 
If I were to pick two single, most important characteristics to describe in myself, I'd choose that I am an artistic maker of things & spaces, and that I adore being a person. 

HMMM... WHAT DO I LIKE?  
Well, I'm an avid and high-speed reader. The apartment, the Pink Room, and my home are filled with books. 
Language, for me, holds an endless fascination. While I am not multi-lingual, I consider communication a most important human activity. Telling and listening is, when practiced, what brings the world together. Additionally, my daughter, who is still at home and often my co-host, is fully bi-lingual in Russian and English, as well as being fairly proficient in ASL. We both have some Spanish. My hope is that guests trust that whatever their point of origin, they will feel comfortable here.

Feeling at home in the world, for myself, my family, and others, has always been a vital theme for me. I've lived and worked on St. Kitts in the West Indies, hosted several different exchange students from Russia, given  presentations about Solar Energy in Kenya, lived in the woods in Northern Vermont, worked with trauma survivors for much of my career, taught building skills and trades work, and in these last many years, found a way to thrive in an urban environment.

As a mother of 3 and 'Babaka' now to two grandchildren, my core beliefs about staying in my own integrity, living out of my deepest artistic sensibility, and trying with a tenacity that never stops, have served me well.

My style as a host for Airbnb is to offer, as best I can, as little, or as much, as is wanted by my guests.

Here's a little bit about me-
I studied photography and worked as a professional photographer for the past 25 years. My favorite type of photography is Documentary and photo journalism. You might see some images of my work around my home.
I know my city well, and I love giving my guests tips and ideas for fun things to do. So please tell me a little bit about you and why you are coming to Boston. wether you want to stay local and find out more about JP, or if you want to explore the downtown areas of our city, I can guide you. 
I also consider myself a new urban gardener. I started a small gardening business a few years ago, and I participate in a community garden down the street from my place. 
I especially love meeting new people and hearing their stories. After traveling through Italy this past Spring (2015) and staying at several airbnb's, I decided to try it myself. I think I will make a great AIRBNB host because I like to make people feel comfortable and I like to chat. We went to Italy to celebrate my daughter's graduation from Syracuse University. We really enjoyed the AIRBNB experiences we had.  
My friends say my home is very welcoming and friendly. Currently, my daughter and another Syracuse Grad are living on the second floor with me and our cute cat named Remi.

He is a very sweet, gentle-natured, strong willed, and energetic family dog. Some people may be afraid of a large notorious breed such as his, and if so, this is probably not the listing you should respond to. Just know that, though Clyde may jump in your lap and lick your face, he has never had a seriously negative interaction with a human or dog. Also of note: most of the pictures are from the listing when we recently purchased the house. Nothing has changed structurally, but the space is now ""lived in"", and some of the furniture has been upgraded.

Option 2: The PINK ROOM, available every day all year round, is a beautiful private room in our three bedroom home. This custom built (by me, with help) house, is an urban artist's paradise that feels like a cottage in the woods. 

A BIT ABOUT ME: 
If I were to pick two single, most important characteristics to describe in myself, I'd choose that I am an artistic maker of things & spaces, and that I adore being a person. 

HMMM... WHAT DO I LIKE?  
Well, I'm an avid and high-speed reader. The apartment, the Pink Room, and my home are filled with books. 
Language, for me, holds an endless fascination. While I am not multi-lingual, I consider communication a most important human activity. Telling and listening is, when practiced, what brings the world together. Additionally, my daughter, who is still at home and often my co-host, is fully bi-lingual in Russian and English, as well as being fairly proficient in ASL. We both have some Spanish. My hope is that guests trust that whatever their point of origin, they will feel comfortable here.

Feeling at home in the world, for myself, my family, and others, has always been a vital theme for me. I've lived and worked on St. Kitts in the West Indies, hosted several different exchange students from Russia, given  presentations about Solar Energy in Kenya, lived in the woods in Northern Vermont, worked with trauma survivors for much of my career, taught building skills and trades work, and in these last many years, found a way to thrive in an urban environment.

As a mother of 3 and 'Babaka' now to two grandchildren, my core beliefs about staying in my own integrity, living out of my deepest artistic sensibility, and trying with a tenacity that never stops, have served me well.

My style as a host for Airbnb is to offer, as best I can, as little, or as much, as is wanted by my guests.

Some of the most amazing times in my life have come about through traveling or hosting travelers to this beautiful city. I love meeting new people, hearing about their adventures, learning more about where they come from, and helping them have a wonderful time here in Boston. 

I've had Thai people help me count the steps out loud in Thai when visiting  a mountain temple in Chiang Mai. I've kayaked from Cambridge, down the Charles River, through the locks, out into Boston Harbor, and into a dock outside The Barking Crab restaurant for a lunch of fried clams—a local favorite! I've been to New Orleans to work with Habitat for Humanity in rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. I've hiked the White Mountains. I've trekked France, I've studied Spanish in Madrid, I've tossed bread crumbs to fish in Greece. 

Come to Boston, and I'll do everything I can to make sure you make wonderful new travel memories here, dining under my grape arbor, visiting your children's college, walking the Freedom Trail or whatever else you wind up doing!

Here's a little bit about me-
I studied photography and worked as a professional photographer for the past 25 years. My favorite type of photography is Documentary and photo journalism. You might see some images of my work around my home.
I know my city well, and I love giving my guests tips and ideas for fun things to do. So please tell me a little bit about you and why you are coming to Boston. wether you want to stay local and find out more about JP, or if you want to explore the downtown areas of our city, I can guide you. 
I also consider myself a new urban gardener. I started a small gardening business a few years ago, and I participate in a community garden down the street from my place. 
I especially love meeting new people and hearing their stories. After traveling through Italy this past Spring (2015) and staying at several airbnb's, I decided to try it myself. I think I will make a great AIRBNB host because I like to make people feel comfortable and I like to chat. We went to Italy to celebrate my daughter's graduation from Syracuse University. We really enjoyed the AIRBNB experiences we had.  
My friends say my home is very welcoming and friendly. Currently, my daughter and another Syracuse Grad are living on the second floor with me and our cute cat named Remi.

We have two sons, 13 & 12, and we love to avail ourselves of the city and community we love. We coach baseball, basketball, and flag football, and love to explore, meet new people, and share what we know about Boston with anyone interested. 

For many years we hosted international students coming to Boston to study English and have hosted folks from Korea, Japan, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Kazakhstan. These former guests are now good friends and we enjoyed being their ambassadors to Boston.

I've got the bug and can't wait for more - I am fascinated with people and humanity, which includes the history and culture of each place I visit.  As a traveler I spend a lot of time wandering around places, people watching, or finding quiet places to enjoy the nature and try to stay fairly centrally located so I can walk and take things in slowly.

Kenji here. I  don't like describing my self. Writing from my home in the JP neighborhood of Boston. Today I got to stay at home. I work freelance in film production so I get a lot of time off between projects. My job is best described as ""art department"" although, set builder, propmaker, prop, effects, set dresser... are other terms for the work I do. Anyway, art dept. is what I write on my time cards. Today I did none of that. I fixed up a couple of 80's Japanese road bikes and one 60's Raleigh 3 speed in the sun in front of our house. Me and my daughter are getting ready to go down to NYC where we will set up our wares for sale on the street in Brooklyn (15 bikes and a table of her arts and crafts). Can't wait. It's super fun to be on the street talking to the people, hearing the music from the passing traffic, smiling at the ladies, eating crazy street food, and putting people on nice bikes. This is the best kind of day for me. It's got everything, travel, all kinds of people, my daughter w/ me, friends dropping by, a couple bucks in my pocket, truck tacos, street fashion... Magdalena , my 15 year old, creative, self possessed, funny, daughter makes me feel proud and secure when she hawks her crafts. I look at her talk everyone, so confident, open hearted but savvy, and I feel like she's gonna be okay where ever she goes. The art of survival. I'm an artist. Sculptor. Went to art school. Can make anything. But what I love most to make is my way thru life. It's the best art. But unlike art it is totally accessible because everyone does it. blaa blaa... back to today... I also did some drawings for a chicken coop that I'm going to build next week with my buddy Jenny. Some local chicken activists approached us with the project. These chicken people want to repeal laws that prevent keeping chickens in the city of Boston. They would like to display some chickens at our local earth/may day festival in a clean,(hopefully) well designed, urban chicken coop. What else? I fixed the passenger side headlight of my truck, paid some bills, ate some mochi, did the dark laundry, made some calls to spread the word about a friend who is on his last legs in a fight w/cancer, pulled some bamboo shoots that were creeping ever further out of their corner of the yard. Magdalena came home tonight beaming. There was an after school dance, ice cream with friends afterwards and thrift shopping after that. She sat on the couch and gave me a play by play of her day. I love that
Well, there it is. I think that worked out pretty good. It's a good thing I didn't work today or you'd of heard all about it...
IE: today I built a city diorama in 1"":1' scale. Went pretty smooth but the tiny bus stop benches looked gigantic next to the wee news paper boxes. Weird because both were built with out straying from the 1"":1' format. It just goes to show you, sometimes it's best to set the rules aside and go with your eye and your heart.
