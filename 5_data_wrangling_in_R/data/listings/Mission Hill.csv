Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",within an hour,100%,100%,FALSE,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mission Hill,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",TRUE,TRUE,"Wait St, Boston, MA 02120, United States",Mission Hill,Mission Hill,NA,Boston,MA,02120,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.33215157576381,-71.10674178342134,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1,0,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,Breakfast,""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials}",NA,$75.00,$490.00,"$1,800.00",NA,NA,1,$0.00,1,60,today,NA,2,3,11,281,2016-09-06,404,2011-01-15,2016-08-20,78,8,7,9,9,9,8,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,7,5.87

I traveled back and forth to Boston during the mid-80's and 90's. I'm the founder of a non-profit organization here in Boston called, ""Bikes Not Bombs"" (BNB) where i worked for 25 years coordinating the international work as well as helping to start the inner city youth programs here in Boston and a bike shop which BNB currently operates.  Sixteen years ago, my partner Cecilia and I started to create a family, we have one 15 year old son named Ziggy. Cecilia is from Argentina and we are all bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking. Cecilia is currently working as a case manager for a live at home elderly services and support organization. In 2010 my family and I traveled by public busses for two years, homeschooling our son and witnessing life in nine South and Central American countries. We started the trip by car camping across the USA for 3 months, then selling the car, flying to Buenos Aires and slowly returning over land by bus, boat, and train, on two occasions we also did WOOFING on family farms.   
I'm currently doing carpentry and handyman work, but because of some issues with pinched nerves i'm looking to find more ways to make a living including airbnb.  I love traveling, bird watching, hiking in nature, fishing, books, cooking, art, bike riding and sustainable organic gardening among other things. I tend our 30' by 60' garden and grape arbor which makes our house exceptionally nice from May to November.
I know Boston metro-plex quite well and can help you to get around on or off the beaten track.

Fenway Park and the Museum of Fine Arts are a within a twenty minute walk. The Hill has that authentic old Boston feel without the longer commute. Public Transportation is great in Mission Hill. My listing's address has a 100/100 transitscore and a 90+ walkscore. There are a plethora of schools in Boston and the surrounding towns. Mission Hill is known for its large student and medical professional populations, as Northeastern University, Harvard Medical School, the Fenway Colleges, and the Longwood medical institutions are adjacent to Mission Hill.  The nearest grocery store is a 5-10 minute walk away at Brigham Circle. The apartment building is neighbored by a Dunkin Donuts on one side and a bodega on the other side, which has some basic items.  Mission Hill may not be as upscale as Beacon Hill, but it is safe, Boston Police Headquarters is just a few blocks away in Roxbury. I have lived","1. There is a locked room in the apartment, the owner uses it for her storage closet. There is a locked accordion door that just goes to the stairs to the unoccupied utility area in the basement. 2. I will take your trash out every 2-3 days (if your stay is longer than 3+ days).  I must do this in order to keep the space clean and unwelcoming for pests. I will try to do it when you're not inside.  3. I live in another apartment in the same building, It's around back. I have my own entrance through the back of the building.  4. The gap between the fridge and the sink/counter is somewhat narrow. Average-size people have no problem at all walking through this area. However a very large person might not fit through this gap so easily. Someone who needs two airplane seats is probably too big to comfortably walk between the fridge and the counter.  5. This place is a good fit for medical professionals visiting Longwood Medical Center. Or a tourism traveler looking for a convenient and low-ke","MBTA ""The T"" INFORMATION: This apartment is about a one minute walk from the Orange Line.  Downtown Crossing can be reached in 10-15 minutes. Back Bay Station is three stops inbound. The E Branch of the Green Line is a 5-10 minute walk away. This segment of the Green Line is a street level train.  The 66 bus to Harvard Square stops just across the street from the Orange Line station. This bus is a great option if you'd like to visit Harvard Square, Coolidge Corner, Brookline, or Allston. PARKING INFORMATION: Parking is a finite resource in Boston. I do not want guests that are only interested in staying here just because of the parking. Please be aware that non-residents who park on my street make it harder for my neighbors to find a spot near their home. Leave your car at home, you don't need it here. I DO NOT recommend bringing a car to Boston, but parking is free on the street. I can not guarantee a parking space, but finding a spot is usually not a problem. I've never had a guest t","Guests have their own apartment (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen) on the first floor. There is a locked room in the apartment, the owner of the building uses it for her storage closet. I do not have access to it.  There is a locked accordion door that just goes to the steps to the basement, there isn't anything down there, just the water heater. The fire escape cannot be used as a deck or patio.","I will try my hardest to meet you when you check-in. I live in a separate apartment in the same building, it's around back, so if you need anything, just let me know. I will respect your privacy and stay out of your way, but I'm also happy to give advice to travelers as well.","Please be mindful that I live in the same building. If you break these rules, I will probably know about it. I have had the rare guests that caused problems, so I do take the rules quite seriously.   All guests must be OVER 21 years old to stay.  No parties and/or visitors. Do not bring your own guests or visitors over. Do not show up with your friends/family that are in the area. The only people allowed in the listing are the guests (2 adults max, including yourself) that are included in your reservation. You can not bring anyone else over, even if it's just for a few minutes. No exceptions, so please don't ask. I'm picky about this rule because I have had college kids try to book this place for parties and gatherings.  Please turn off the AC and lights when you go outside. Please be respectful of the neighbors and the listing. This isn't a place to be rowdy. No smoking anywhere. Please no e-cig/vaping either.
