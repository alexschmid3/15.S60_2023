It is named after the town of Brighton in the English city of Brighton and Hove. For its first 160 years Brighton was part of Cambridge and was known as “Little Cambridge."" Throughout much of its early history it was a rural town with a significant commercial center at its eastern end. Brighton separated from Cambridge in 1807 after a bridge dispute and was annexed to Boston, in 1874.[2] The neighborhood of Allston was also formerly part of the Town of Brighton but is now often considered separately, leading to the moniker Allston-Brighton for the combined area.","I will be doing the drop-off and pick-up service at the Logan airport.

Our names are Lorin and Melissa. We have been roommates for a year and share a cozy apartment 15 minutes outside of Boston with our two cats Puck and Oliver. We love our home and neighborhood and hope to share it with you.

We both are young professionals who take work very seriously. Lorin works as an accountant downtown and takes the expressway bus which is a quick 20 minute ride. While Melissa is attending Boston College to obtain her masters in higher education while also working in the Dean of Students office and will mainly be driving around.

After work and on the weekends we are usually busy exploring the many facets this beautiful city of Boston has to offer. 

We love to cook dinner together and we hope you will join us occasionally. We enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing on our porch and watching the city around us move. We will also take a relaxing evening in watching a movie or catching up on a television show while putting together a puzzle. Of course we love going out to a bar close by playing trivia or getting dolled up and headed downtown for more of an extravagant evening.

I am Katharina. I grew up and studied in Germany but moved to the US for work. I have been living in Boston now since August 2012. In my free time I do a lot of sports: triathlon, skiing, rowing,... what is perfect to do in Boston. Apart from that I love to travel (Europe, Southern and Northern America and South- East Africa...), meeting new people, read and go to the theater or ballet. I used airbnb before with a friend who also has an account here and loved it. I think it is such a great idea, so that is why I now created my own account :-). When I travel I like to have a clean and quite place to relax and to explore the city.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

I am a British Citizen and have been brought up in an international environment. I currently live in Switzerland and I am relocating back to the U.S. (I use to live in NYC) and will be working in the luxury hotel corporate market in the Finical District in San Fran. 

I am looking for a modern, clean and convenient apartment and with some cool down to earth roommates. I like to enjoy a beer after work with my house mates but also some times like some privacy too. On the weekends it would be fantastic to live with a group of people who enjoy socialising and are open to meeting new people. 

I enjoy skiing, traveling, cuisine and also going out on the weekends, as I work extremely hard towards my career.

For a long term rental if you wanted to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or meet for a beer before hand it could be arranged.

Have a good one! Cheers,
